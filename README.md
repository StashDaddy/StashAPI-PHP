# StashAPI-PHP
PHP version of the Stash API

This API allows you to interact with your STASH Vault through your custom applications.

Get started in 3 easy steps:
* Request and have your STASH account configured for API access and obtain your API_ID and API_PW
* Install the PHP API via Composer (composer require stash/stashapi) or download the STASH API and manually add it to your project
* Build your application by configuring the STASHAPI class properties and call the STASHAPI class helper function methods.

If you need the documentation or unit testing files, clone or download the repo as the composer package does not install these by default.
